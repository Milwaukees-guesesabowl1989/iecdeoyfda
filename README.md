Just staggered out of the theater, wow. The air’s cold on my skin, popcorn in my lap like a forgotten sandcastle. My mind’s all over the place, like the puzzle pieces of that  . Bring Her Back. What even was real? The echo in the theater — my ears still buzzing. It was like a kaleidoscope of sound and emotion, you know?

< The scene with the rain – why so much rain? The water was like another character. Slippery and dark. Kept thinking about how my back hurts. Dumb seats. And when she looked in the mirror and saw herself but not herself? Mirrors in the theater bathroom felt alive, too. Creepy. I needed to splash water on my face… wait, not more water!

The actors, they were these shadows moving, blending in the flicker of the screen. My soda was flat by the end, still cold though. Everything felt paradoxical – saw her run through the alley, but also, was I running? Felt like it. That alley scene, reminded me of that time I got lost in a city I didn’t know. Always the alleys. Not soft like a bed at all. Surprised how many people still say 'you gotta 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  ' like hello, theaters.

> There was that twist – the one with the old man and the photograph. Just never saw it coming. Like my Uncle Jim suddenly pulling a rabbit from his pocket at a funeral. Makes no sense but profound or something. Crumbs everywhere. Gonna find them in my shoes later. Drives me nuts.

What was that someone said? “𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again”? Maybe, even if my eyes are still blinking 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 reels. They really don’t make ‘em like that anymore – or ever? The sodium light outside is fake and real just like what I saw. Backaches turn into questions, huh.

> Wide shots, narrow escapes in the mind. Tail lights like a waking dream. Am I still in that world? Sleepwalking on the sidewalk now. Funny seeing the crowd narrow and scatter like a flock of birds. Just—no, wait. Somebody's phone’s vibrating louder than claps in the theater. Distractions, like life in a spotlight bubble.
